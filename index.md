### Course Summary

The course covers core and modern computer vision and machine learning for visual data, with a focus on embodied intelligence and active perception.

### Course Content

Visual perception infers properties of the world from light. Biological systems do this efficiently and robustly; computer vision aims to replicate this in machines. Despite major progress (for example, recognition systems), a gap remains to animal-level perception.

The goal is to understand both what current vision systems can do and what remains unsolved, using ideas from both machine learning and biological perception.

The course combines lectures and a substantial hands-on project. Students are encouraged to work in groups, propose ambitious but feasible ideas, and tackle open visual perception problems with guidance from the teaching team.

### Lecture Topics

1. Basic computer vision concepts: classification, detection, grouping, transformations, optical flow, 3D from X, and modern architectures such as Transformers.
2. Psychology/physiology of the visual system.
3. Perception-action loop: active perception and embodied vision.
4. Multimodal perception.

The course is intended for master's/PhD students (and advanced undergraduates) interested in computer vision, machine learning, and perceptual robotics.

### Prerequisites

- Machine Learning (CS-433) or Introduction to Machine Learning (CS-233), or equivalent.
- Deep Learning (EE-559) or Artificial Neural Networks (CS-456), or equivalent.

### Recommended Background

- Computer Vision (CS-442) or equivalent undergraduate/masters course.

### Important Concepts Before Starting

- Deep learning and machine learning.
- Python programming.
- Basics of probability and statistics.

### Expected Student Activities

- For lectures: study readings, participate actively, and complete homework.
- For projects: define and implement an in-depth project, show continuous progress, and submit a final report and presentation.
